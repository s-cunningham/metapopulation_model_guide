In this tutorial, we walk readers through an example to provide a basis of understanding on how to set up and run analyses in this program.\nNote: This is not an exhaustive tutorial, and there are many settings we skip over because they are not applicable to our study."

    "text": "1. Edit RAMAS Config Module\n\nTo be able to import the entirety of a large raster, you have to change the number of raster cells in the configuration module. In the Maxima tab, the default number of rows and columns (400 rows, 500 columns) is too few, in our case for Mississippi at a 1 km2 resolution. Therefore, we changed the map rows and map columns values (in red box in figure below) to slightly higher than the dimensions of our raster (545 rows, 317 columns). RAMAS has a limit of 16,000 cells in both columns and rows. Click save.\n\n\n\n\ntest"
